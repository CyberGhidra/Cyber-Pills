# Linux Distribution

# Introduction to Linux

## 🐧 What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source operating system (OS)**.

### ✔ The OS is a Resource Manager
An operating system manages the computer's resources, including:

- **Processor time** — decides which process uses the CPU  
- **Memory (RAM)** — allocates memory to applications  
- **Storage space** — manages files and disk usage

## 🔧 Kernel  
The **kernel** is the *core of the operating system*.

- It is the **lowest level** of the OS  
- Acts as a bridge between **hardware and software**  
- Handles CPU, memory, processes, drivers, and system calls  

The kernel is what makes Linux *Linux*.

# 💿 What is a Linux Distribution?

A **Linux distribution (distro)** is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel.  
Different distros include different components, tools, and philosophies.

### ✔ Key Components of a Distribution

Tools that install, update, and remove software.  
Examples:
- APT (Debian/Ubuntu)
- DNF (Fedora)
- PACMAN (Arch)
- Zypper (openSUSE)

### **Applications**
Each distro includes its own set of preinstalled software:
- File manager  
- Terminal  
- Browser  
- System tools  

### **Goals / Aims / Philosophy**
Different distros have different purposes:

- **Ubuntu:** user-friendly desktop  
- **Debian:** stability  
- **Arch:** simplicity & control  
- **Kali:** security & penetration testing  
- **Fedora:** latest technologies
