# The SOC and Its Role

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit within an organization responsible for handling security issues, incidents, and events.

## SOC Core Functions

### 1. Monitor
- Continuous observation for unusual activity  
- Use of monitoring tools (IDS, SIEM, etc.) for real-time visibility  
- Early detection of potential security threats  

### 2. Detect
- Confirm security events identified during monitoring  
- Utilize threat detection techniques  
- Identify known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  

### 3. Analyze
- Perform in-depth investigations to understand incidents  
- Examine affected systems and build a timeline of events  
- Trace Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)  

### 4. Respond
- Formulate a response plan based on findings  
- Contain threats, mitigate impact, and restore normal operations  
- Collaborate with internal teams and stakeholders  

# People, Process, and Technology (PPT Framework)

The SOC relies on three pillars to operate effectively:

## People
- Analysts  
- Incident responders  
- Engineers  

## Process
- Incident Response (IR) plans  
- Playbooks and defined procedures  

## Technology
- SIEM  
- IDS/IPS  
- EDR solutions  

## CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Protect data from unauthorized access  
- **Integrity** – Ensure data is trustworthy and unaltered  
- **Availability** – Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed

# Key Functions of a SOC

SOC activities fall into two categories: **Reactive** and **Proactive**.

## Reactive Functions

### Monitoring and Detection
- Analyze system and network logs  
- Utilize SIEM, IDS, and alerts  
- Perform alert triage  

### Incident Response
- Investigate, contain, and mitigate threats  
- Collect evidence and artifacts  
- Communicate with stakeholders  

### Forensic Analysis
- Conduct in-house or third-party forensic investigations  
- Determine scope and root cause  
- Preserve evidence and support legal processes  

### Malware Analysis
- Reverse engineer malware samples  
- Study malware behavior  
- Collect Indicators of Compromise

## Proactive Functions

### Threat Intelligence
- Gather and analyze threat intel  
- Study vulnerabilities and emerging attacks  
- Feed intelligence into detection tools  

### Threat Hunting
- Search for malicious activity or intrusions  
- Analyze logs, network traffic, and endpoint telemetry  
- Use threat intelligence to identify known patterns  

### Vulnerability Management
- Identify and address vulnerabilities  
- Scan, assess, and apply patches  
- Coordinate remediation efforts  

### Security Awareness Training
- Promote security best practices  
- Educate employees on policies and threat prevention
